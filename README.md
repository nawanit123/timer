I have created this project to learn and understand the DOM Manipulation in browsers with a cool fun project that I may enhance further in the future.

## Steps:
  1. Enter value in the input box and press enter to trigger the timer.
  2. Click pause and play buttons for pausing and restarting the timer.
  

## Features;
  1. Simple timer app using native javascript.
  2. Manipulation of Dom.
  3. ~~Use of getter and setter.~~ [Update] Removed getter and setter method in class because of scalability issue.
  4. Use of class in javascript.
  5. Implemented svg element in the html.


## Features to add in future
  1. Upgrading the project to implement pomodoro technique.
  2. Currently only takes input as seconds. Want to add minutes and hour functionality in the future.

## Edit
 [Updated]
 1. Added validation on the form input to accept Minutes:Seconds;
