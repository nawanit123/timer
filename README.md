I have created this project to learn and understand the DOM Manipulation in browsers with a cool fun project that I may enhance further   in the future.

  1. Simple timer app using native javascript.
  2. Manipulation of Dom.
  3. Use of getter and setter.
  4. Use of class in javascript.
  5. Implemented svg element in the html.


## Features to add in future
  1. Upgrading the project to implement pomodoro technique.
  2. Currently only takes input as seconds. Want to add minutes and hour functionality in the future.
